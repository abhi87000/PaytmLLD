We have to make 3 API's here,
1. Add Agent(name,phoneNumber,Date of Joining)
2. Assign Manager(managerId, reporterID)
3. Print all reportees (even those who are indirectly reportees)
4. hierarchy looks like this FSE->TL->ASM
5. code should be working and running, was a open book, I could google or chatgpt, use of spring boot and maven was allowed
6. if time permits consider connecting to DB else fine with InMemory
